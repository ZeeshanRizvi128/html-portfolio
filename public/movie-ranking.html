<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spider Man 2</h3>
<p>The perfect superhero movie. It has great action and drama,<br />
    and it really cuts deep into the core of who Spider-Man is.
</p>
<h3>Spider Man: Into the Spider-verse</h3>
<p>This movie was made by Spider-Man fans, for Spider-Man fans.<br />
With so many great refernces to the characters history, it builds<br />
upon as well as adds to the character in a way no movie or franchise<br />
has ever done. </p>
<h3>Spider Man 1</h3>
<p>Without this movie, modern superhero movies wouldnt be as popular. <br />
This movie proved that superhero movies could be serious, action packed,<br />
and well made; all while delivering an amazing origin story, introducing him<br />
to many generations to come.</p>
